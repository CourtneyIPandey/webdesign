      <h4>Answers To Top 8 Questions</h4>
      <ol>
         <li id="q1">"Chelsea Handler took her SATs on acid, so she never got accepted to college, 
            but she had a great time taking that test."</li>
         <li id="q2">"A [explicit]"</li>
         <li id="q3">"No. I think vegan people fart a lot, and I've been around them, and I've smelled their farts, 
            and I'm not interested in being vegan because of that. Although I am down with being a vegetarian, 
            and not eating animals. I'm ready to go in that direction, and I think we're all kind of heading in that direction, 
            whether we want to be or not."</li>
         <li id="q4">"Funny you should mention that. I'm 45 years old, so I'm in my middle life. Does that sound sexy?"</li>
         <li id="q5">"I would say, 'Life Will Be The Death Of Me', my last book. That was the most personal, the most real. That was post therapy, 
            so it's really raw. That's what I based my new stand-up special on."</li>
         <li id="q6">"Don't worry about it."</li>
         <li id="q7">"Sometimes good, sometimes not so great."</li>
         <li id="q8">"I am a Pisces, and if you're into Enneagrams, I'm a number eight."</li>
